# Fodenn F10 Review

## Connectivity
### External
![Back](/assets/images/Fodenn_F10/back.jpg "Back") ![Front](/assets/images/Fodenn_F10/front.jpg "Front")

- **Ports**: We find 4 USB 3.0 ports, 2 HDMI ports, a headphone jack and a LAN port.
- **Indicators**: Power and CLR COMS lights for quick status checks.
- **Wireless**: Realtek 8821CE ensures a robust wireless experience with Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11ac.
- **Notable**: Well-organized ports with rear placement of 2 USB, 2 HDMI, LAN and power port, with a convenient front setup for the power button, 2 USB and headset jack.
- **Defects**: Unfortunately, no USB type C port, which could be a drawback for some users.

### Internal
![Inside](/assets/images/Fodenn_F10/inside.jpg)
- **Expansion**:  Limited M.2 and RAM slots (one each) but compensates with an additional SATA 2.5 bay.
- **Cable Management**: Efficient design for rapid access to internal components, allowing easy upgrades.
- **Accessibility**: Quick internal access with just 4 screws.

## Hardware
### CPU
- **Intel N95**: This processor, with Alder Lake architecture, runs at 1.7GHz base speed, reaching a max of 3.4GHz, featuring 4 Cores and a 15W TDP.
- **Performance in Windows 11**: 
  - Geekbench [Results](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/4762636).
  - Cinebench: SingleCore 60pt, MultiCore 95pt.
- **Performance in Ubuntu 22.04**: 
  - Geekbench [Results](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/4770770).
  - Cinebench SingleCore 60pt, MultiCore 95pt, SingleCore 60pt.
  - Compression 7zip [Results](https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2402053-NE-COMPRES7Z71).
  - OpenSSL [Results](https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2402051-NE-OPENSSL9622).

### RAM
- **Memory**: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz
- **Performance**:
  - RAM speed [Results](https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2402054-NE-RAMSPEED498)
- **Upgradability**: Supports up to 16GB DDR5 4800MHz

### Storage
- **Types**: One 512GB ShiJi M.2 SSD
- **Speed**: ![Cristal Disk Mark](/assets/images/Fodenn_F10/CDisk2.png)
- **Upgradability**: Only one M.2 slot, but the presence of an extra SATA bay allows for storage expansion.
- **Defects**: During one of the initial startup sessions (within the second or third boot and less than an hour of uptime), noteworthy metrics surfaced regarding the SSD. With readings such as 85 Power On Count, 34 Power On Hours, Total Reads > 2TB, and total Host Writes >2TB, it raises the possibility that the SSD might not be entirely new. While this could be attributed to the preinstalled Windows operating system, the relatively high figures prompt consideration.

### GPU
- **Integrated GPU**: Intel® UHD Graphics, running at 1.20GHz and supporting 4K resolution at 60Hz.
- **Performance**:
  - Geekbench [Results](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/compute/1715331)

## Other
### Heat Dissipation and Noise
- **Cooling**: Efficient cooling with temperatures ranging from 40C at idle to a maximum of 70C under full load.
- **Noise Levels**: Remarkably quiet operation with a single fan, nearly indiscernible unless closely inspected.
- **Stability**: Consistent stability without high-temperature spikes, as the device remains reliably cool, about 70-80 degree even during prolonged usage and under full load.

### Power Consumption
- **Usage Details**:
  - Under full load, the Fodenn F10 draws approximately 15W, translating to a daily consumption of 0.36kW.
  - During normal home lab usage with around 2% CPU usage, the power consumption hovers around 7W, equating to a daily usage of 0.168kW.
  - In idle mode, it consumes a mere 5W, resulting in a minimal daily usage of 0.12kW.

### Packaging

- **Contents**: Unbox a complete package featuring the MiniPC, along with a 20cm HDMI cable, a 1m HDMI cable, a Power Supply, a convenient Mounting Bracket (complete with screws), and an informative User Manual.
- **Consideration**: I was pleasantly surprised by the presence of two HDMI cables which is not so common in these products

## Price
_Last update 22/02/2024_
- **Purchase**: Acquired from Amazon at €189.99.
- **Current Availability**: [Fodenn F10 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0CJNBVZC2?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=magform-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=784afe9457c30904d3b7bf4998c9c7c1&camp=3414&creative=21718) for 269.99€.
- **Other options**: We can find several alternatives to this mini PC, especially on Aliexpress in particular:
  - Practically equal | [Beelink Mini S](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJUSurB) --> 196.99€
  - 4 ETH port and N100 CPU | [Toptop  firewall computer](https://a.aliexpress.com/_Eukcpeh) --> 255.99€
  - N100 CPU |  [FIREBAT T8 Pro Plus](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHjwuTn) --> 151.69€
- **Value**: Comparing it with some similar devices we see that, with a price of 269.99€, it is off the market. However, if you manage to get it at a discount or in any case paying for it under 200€ then the purchase becomes reasonable also having Amazon's assistance and customer service.

## Other Details
