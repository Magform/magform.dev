Hi, I'm Nicolas Ferraresso aka Magform! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a developer currently studying computer engineering at the University of Padua in Italy.

## Interests

- **3D Modeling and Printing:** I love creating 3D models with Fusion360 and bringing them to life with my modded Ender3.

- **Embedded Systems:** I enjoy working with embedded systems, including platforms like mbed, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. Designing custom hardware and programming microcontrollers to bring innovative projects to life.

- **Server and Self-Hosting:** I'm experienced in setting up and maintaining my servers for various applications and services.

- **Prototyping:** I'm always eager to prototype new ideas using Arduino or other embedded systems, I especially like to create new integrations to automate devices at home.

- **Cybersecurity:** I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and challenges in the field.

- **Body Hacking:** Exploring the intersection of technology and the human body fascinates me.

## Education and Skills

I'm currently pursuing my degree in computer engineering at Padua, Italy, where I've had the opportunity to learn various programming languages and techniques through a diverse range of courses. In particular, I've gained proficiency in languages like C++, Java, python and GO as well as skills in embedded systems, automatic controls and optimization.

One notable achievement during my university journey is my participation in the university project called [Metis](http://metisvela.dii.unipd.it/). In particular, I am a member of the team that deals with the development and maintenance of [SailTrack](https://github.com/metis-vela-unipd).

I had the incredible opportunity to participate in an Erasmus program at [Mittuniversitetet](https://www.miun.se/en/) in Sweden. This experience allowed me to broaden my horizons, experience a different educational environment, and collaborate with international peers, further enriching my knowledge and skills.

My academic and practical experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in computer engineering, programming, and problem-solving, making me well-prepared for exciting challenges and projects in the tech world.
